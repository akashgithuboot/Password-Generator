# Password-Generator
In this homework project I have been tasked to create a function which returns a randomly generated password based on some user input.  The website generates a password of a length between 8 and 128 characters (decided by the user), and uses at least one type of character from "special" characters (symbols like %, !, $ for example, a full list was used from: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters), numbers (0-9), lower case and upper case characters (a,b,..z and A,B,...Z). I have also included some logic so that when the user picks a set of characters it is guaranteed to be included in the password.  I used and learnt about a range of interesting JavaScript including:  The alert, prompt and confirm methods to gain user input Conditional statements, and loops (for, do. While and while) Arrays and Array methods and the Math object, specifically Math. Random It also gave me an opportunity to think about logic and how to use JavaScript to achieve this.
