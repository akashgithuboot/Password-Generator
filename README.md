In this homework project I have been tasked to create a function which returns a randomly generated password based on some user input.

The website generates a password of a length between 8 and 128 characters , and uses at least one type of character from "special" characters

I have also included some logic so that when the user picks a set of characters it is guaranteed to be included in the password.
